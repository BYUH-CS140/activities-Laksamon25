          <p><b>A lantern festival</b> in Thailand is a breathtaking celebration of light, tradition, and spirituality. 
            One of the most famous is Yi Peng, held in Chiang Mai. During this festival, thousands of glowing sky lanterns (called khom loi) are released into the night sky, 
            symbolizing the letting go of bad luck and misfortune. People gather around temples and rivers dressed in traditional Thai clothing, making wishes as they release their lanterns.</p>

            <p>At the same time, <b>Loy Krathong</b> is celebrated across Thailand, where people float beautifully decorated banana-leaf baskets (krathong) on rivers to pay respect to the water goddess and cleanse away negativity. 
            The scene is magicalâ€”lanterns drifting in the sky, krathongs lighting up the water, fireworks in the distance, and a deep sense of peace and hope all around.</p>
